        "intro": "Greyforge, the mountain city in the north of the Kaldarian lands is home to the proud dwarves who settled in the area over 8,000 years ago, led by a silver dragon, according to some stories.\nFamous for their expertise in crafting and artifice, the Greyforge dwarves use giant lava powered furnaces, deep underground, to process the toughest metals.\nScholars and mages travel here from all over the continent in search of ancient lore in the dusty tomes of the Greyforge library, which is famed as the largest library in all Aradia.\nMost of the city lies safely under the surface of the mountain making it easily defensible. A strong military force is ready to defend the city at all times from threats of goblinoid clans vying for control of the natural resources of the area and hungry herds of monstrous beasts.\nApart from dwarves, many other ancestries call Greyforge home: humans, gnomes, halflings, tieflings and dragonborn.\nMore than anything, Greyforge is your home. You spend your whole life in the sheltered walls of the great stone city. Today, a day like any other, you are summoned by Corvus Stouthammer, proprietor of the Stout Meal Inn, one of the oldest establishments in the city. He said he has a quick job for you.",
