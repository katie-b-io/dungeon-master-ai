      - 1709: Okay. You pull out your arrow and as you pull it back, a little bit of energy courses through your fingers, strikes through your arrow. You can now see this crackling energy as you're pulling it taut in your bow. You let it loose, roll for attack.

      - 1065: Anything you want to do in preparation for the next day?
      - 1099: Hello, everyone. Welcome back. We've had our pee breaks. We've had our refills of our drinks. We've got Fireball, so I think we're good for the next venture. Anyway, the party has taken their rest for the evening. Once again, this is one of those weird experiences where you wake up, not because of the sun rising, because you can't see it in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, but eventually you all come to consciousness naturally. What is your plan of action?
      - 1198: Well, what's your business, if I might ask again? You already seen the statue.
      - 1349: Do you have on your person any sort of thieve' tools?
      - 1357: Do you wish to pick one of the doors?
      - 1665: These guys here are entangled. These front goblins are not. Scorching Ray you said at which ones?

      - 1883: There you go. That's what a shawm sounds like, apparently. You can use it on attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check. Any skill. Tiberius, are you going to stay where you are, are you moving anywhere? Last chance.
      - 1914: It's an aimed ray attack?
      - 1938: Next week, you can donate to then. All right, so that brings us to the end of Tiberius' turn. You want to move at all, are you staying where you are?
      - 1943: What did you roll for stealth, by the way?
      - 1959: What was your to hit roll on that?
      - 2114: Okay! Straight line that way?
